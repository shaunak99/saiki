## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Prerequisites
- Dexto framework installed
- Google AI API key (Gemini API access)
- Node.js 20.0.0 or higher

### Installation
1. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY="your-google-ai-api-key"
   # or
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-google-ai-api-key"
   ```

2. **Run the agent** (the MCP server will be automatically downloaded via npx):
   ```bash
   # From the dexto repository root
   npx dexto -a agents/nano-banana-agent/nano-banana-agent.yml
   ```

The agent configuration uses `npx @truffle-ai/nano-banana-server` to automatically download and run the latest version of the MCP server.

## üìã Available Tools

The agent provides access to 3 essential tools:

### 1. `generate_image`
Generate new images from text prompts.

**Example:**
```
Generate a majestic mountain landscape at sunset in realistic style with 16:9 aspect ratio
```

### 2. `process_image`
Process existing images based on detailed instructions. This tool can handle any image editing task including object removal, background changes, style transfer, adding elements, and more.

**Example:**
```
Remove the red car in the background from /path/to/photo.jpg
```

**Example:**
```
Change the background of /path/to/portrait.jpg to a beach sunset with palm trees
```

**Example:**
```
Apply Van Gogh painting style with thick brushstrokes to /path/to/photo.jpg
```

### 3. `process_multiple_images`
Process multiple images together based on detailed instructions. This tool can combine images, create collages, blend compositions, or perform any multi-image operation.

**Example:**
```
Place the person from /path/to/person.jpg into the landscape from /path/to/landscape.jpg as if they were standing there
```

## üì§ Response Format

Successful operations return both image data and metadata:
```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "image",
      "data": "base64-encoded-image-data",
      "mimeType": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "{\n  \"output_path\": \"/absolute/path/to/saved/image.png\",\n  \"size_bytes\": 12345,\n  \"format\": \"image/png\"\n}"
    }
  ]
