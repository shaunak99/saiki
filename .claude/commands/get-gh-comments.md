# GitHub Review Comment Extractor

Extract and filter GitHub review comments from Dexto pull requests with support for any reviewer.

I'll parse your request and call the appropriate script with the right parameters. You can use natural language like:
- "for PR 293 from rahulkarajgikar" 
- "get unresolved comments from latest CodeRabbit review on PR 456"
- "show all comments from PR 123"

The script I'll use: `./scripts/extract-review-comments.sh truffle-ai/dexto [PR_NUMBER] [OPTIONS]`

## Natural Language Examples

```bash
# Use natural language - Claude will parse these intelligently!
/get-gh-comments for PR 293 from rahulkarajgikar
/get-gh-comments unresolved comments from latest CodeRabbit review on PR 456  
/get-gh-comments show all comments from PR 123
/get-gh-comments latest actionable review from PR 789
/get-gh-comments get PR 555 comments from coderabbitai that are unresolved
```

## Traditional Flag Examples

```bash
# Get all review comments from PR #123
/get-gh-comments 123

# Get CodeRabbit comments only - uses quotes to avoid parsing issues in shell
/get-gh-comments 123 --reviewer "coderabbitai[bot]"

# Get human reviewer comments  
/get-gh-comments 123 --reviewer rahulkarajgikar

# Get latest actionable review from CodeRabbit (substantial feedback) - quotes to avoid issues in shell
/get-gh-comments 123 --reviewer "coderabbitai[bot]" --latest-actionable

# Get all unresolved comments from any reviewer
/get-gh-comments 123 --unresolved-only

# Get unresolved comments from latest actionable review (most useful for CodeRabbit)
/get-gh-comments 123 --reviewer "coderabbitai[bot]" --latest-actionable --unresolved-only

# Get unresolved comments from latest actionable human review
/get-gh-comments 123 --reviewer rahulkarajgikar --latest-actionable --unresolved-only

# Show help
/get-gh-comments 123 --help
```

## Pagination Examples

```bash
# Get first 10 unresolved comments (recommended to avoid output truncation)
/get-gh-comments 123 --unresolved-only --limit 10

# Get next 10 comments (page 2)
/get-gh-comments 123 --unresolved-only --limit 10 --offset 10

# Get comments 21-25 (page 3 of 5-comment pages)
/get-gh-comments 123 --unresolved-only --limit 5 --offset 20

# Browse CodeRabbit feedback in small chunks
/get-gh-comments 123 --reviewer "coderabbitai[bot]" --unresolved-only --limit 5
```

## Defaults

If user doesn't specify, prefer unresolved only. No point in looking at resolved comments generally
If user doesn't specify to use the latest only, run script with both --latest-actionable and without, and consolidate the two to give a meaningful response

## ⚠️ Important: Use Pagination to Avoid Truncation

**Always use `--limit` when there are many comments!** Large PRs with 20+ comments will be truncated in Claude Code's output, causing you to miss important issues. 

Recommended approach:
1. Start with `--limit 10` to see the first batch
2. Use the pagination hints provided by the script to navigate
3. For CodeRabbit reviews, `--limit 5` works well since comments are detailed

## Available Options

### Reviewer Filter
- `--reviewer LOGIN_ID`: Filter by specific reviewer (e.g., `coderabbitai[bot]`, `rahulkarajgikar`, `shaunak99`)

### Pagination Options
- `--limit NUMBER`: Maximum number of comments to display (default: all)
- `--offset NUMBER`: Number of comments to skip (default: 0, for pagination)

### Flags (combinable)
- `--latest-only`: Latest review by timestamp (most recent)
- `--latest-actionable`: Latest review with substantial feedback (has top-level summary)  
- `--unresolved-only`: Only comments that haven't been resolved

*Note*: `--latest-only` and `--latest-actionable` are mutually exclusive. The script uses an `elif` structure where `--latest-actionable` takes precedence if both are provided.

## Common Workflows

**Focus on CodeRabbit's current feedback (paginated):**
```bash
/get-gh-comments 456 --reviewer "coderabbitai[bot]" --latest-actionable --unresolved-only --limit 5
```

**Check all unresolved issues in manageable chunks:**
```bash  
/get-gh-comments 456 --unresolved-only --limit 10
```

**Review human feedback:**
```bash
/get-gh-comments 456 --reviewer username --latest-actionable --limit 10
```

**Browse all feedback from a specific reviewer:**
```bash
/get-gh-comments 456 --reviewer "coderabbitai[bot]" --limit 10
```

## Requirements

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated
- `jq` must be installed for JSON processing
- Access to the target repository
- PR must have review comments

## Notes

- **Actionable Reviews**: Reviews with top-level summaries (body content), typically containing substantial feedback
- **Resolution Status**: Uses GitHub's review thread resolution system
- **Reviewer IDs**: Use GitHub login names (bot accounts include `[bot]` suffix)
- **Comment Sorting**: Comments are automatically sorted by file path and line number for systematic review
- **Pagination Navigation**: The script provides ready-to-use commands for next/previous pages


## ⚠️ Important: Review Before Acting

**ALWAYS review the comments and current code before making changes!**

1. **Read the comments carefully** - CodeRabbit suggestions may be based on outdated code analysis
2. **Check if the issue actually exists** - Test current functionality before "fixing" it
3. **Verify the suggested change is beneficial** - Some suggestions may break working code
4. **Ask the user for confirmation** if you're unsure about a suggested change

## Responding back to user

While responding back to the user, mention the following information:
- Number of total comments (would be at the bottom of the script response)

Then for each comment, mention:
- The number of the comment
- The line number of the comment  
- **The GitHub link** (for easy navigation to the actual comment)
- High level information about what the comment is
- Potential fix: keep this short about what needs to be done to fix it
- Your assessment: whether the fix is actually needed or if current code is correct

This keeps the response concise for the user while also informing them of the essentials

## Handling Incorrect CodeRabbit Comments

When CodeRabbit comments are **incorrect** or based on outdated analysis:

1. **Provide the GitHub links** for manual resolution as invalid
2. **Explain why the comment is wrong** briefly  
3. **Group them clearly**:

```
## Comments to Manually Resolve (CodeRabbit was wrong)

1. **Total count output** - https://github.com/truffle-ai/dexto/pull/293#discussion_r2288992034
   INCORRECT: Script already displays total counts properly

2. **GraphQL -F flag** - https://github.com/truffle-ai/dexto/pull/293#discussion_r2289006182
   INCORRECT: -F is correct for integer parameters, -f is for strings

## Valid Comments Still Needing Fixes
[List the legitimate issues with their links]
