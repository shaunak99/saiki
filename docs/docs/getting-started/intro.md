# Introduction

Dexto is an **agent orchestration layer** that enables the creation of AI-native applications, such as AI assistants and copilots, capable of responding to natural language inputs. By describing your agents and integrating your tools, Dexto orchestrates your databases, APIs, and services to execute tasks based on plain English commands.

## The Intelligence Gap

Most applications today lack the intelligence to understand and act on natural language. You have:
- **Databases** that require SQL knowledge to query
- **APIs** that need technical expertise to integrate
- **Services** that operate in isolation
- **Tools** that require manual operation
- **Systems** that can't communicate with each other

Building AI assistants that can actually use these systems requires complex orchestration—managing state, handling tool calling, coordinating multiple services, and maintaining context across interactions.

## How Dexto Works

Dexto acts as an intelligence layer that:

- **Understands Natural Language** - Converts plain English commands into actionable tasks
- **Plans Intelligently** - Decomposes requests into logical steps and selects appropriate tools
- **Executes Actions** - Coordinates across files, databases, APIs, and web services
- **Maintains Context** - Retains preferences and learns from interactions for personalized responses

Think of Dexto as the **intelligence bridge** between humans and machines—it makes everything you already have conversational and intelligent.

## Transform Anything into an AI Assistant

With Dexto, you can turn:

- **Your SaaS Product** → Conversational AI interface for users
- **Internal APIs** → Intelligent assistants for your team
- **Development Tools** → AI-powered coding companions
- **Business Systems** → Smart automation agents
- **IoT Devices** → Voice-controlled smart systems
- **Data Sources** → Interactive knowledge assistants

## Getting Started with Dexto

Dexto's intelligence layer handles the complexity so you don't have to:

1. **Describe Your Agent** - Define how the AI should behave and what it can do
2. **Integrate Your Tools** - Connect your databases, APIs, and services via MCP
3. **Deploy & Interact** - Launch intelligent assistants that respond to natural language

The intelligence layer manages:
- **Natural Language Processing** - Converts plain English into actionable tasks
- **Intelligent Planning** - Breaks down complex requests into logical steps
- **Tool Execution** - Coordinates actions across multiple systems
- **Context & Memory** - Maintains state and learns from interactions

## Key Features

Dexto comes with everything needed for production-ready AI applications:

- **Local-First** – Operate entirely on your infrastructure, ensuring data privacy and control
- **MCP Integration** – Seamlessly connect with any Model Context Protocol-compatible tool
- **LLM Agnostic** – Utilize various Large Language Models without being tied to a specific provider
- **Multiple Interfaces** – CLI, Web UI, REST API, or embed directly into your applications
- **Enterprise Storage** – Redis, PostgreSQL, SQLite with automatic scaling
- **Observability** – Built-in monitoring, logging, and debugging for complex workflows
