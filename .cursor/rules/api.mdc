This describes the API layer for our AI agents.
These are guidelines that should be followed 90+% of the time.
If you violate any of these rules, give a clear explanation for why

1. APIs need to be thin wrappers around the SaikiAgent class.
The idea is that the SaikiAgent class would be the primary way to build and needs to be user facing.

The API layer is meant to be a thin wrapper around the SaikiAgent class to expose agent functionality over network

If you find that there is too much logic happening at the API layer, figure out a way to get that to move into core layer (SaikiAgent) wherever possible.

APIs should resemble code that users who use our internal core libraries could write without deep internal knowledge of the systems.

2. API layer shouldn't directly be talking to internal services - this is a design choice.

API layer should communicate directly with SaikiAgent for any necessary functionality without talking to internal services as much as possible.
